# MSynth

MSynth is a small Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) for Microsoft Windows written between 2000 until 2003.
It comes with its own UI framework on top of win32. As it was my first larger project, in retrospec code
quality appears mediocre. I missed a lot of parties at the university to be able to write this software.
